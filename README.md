# 100-days-of-planks
100 days of planks: doesn't need to be consecutive days, but it does have to be for at least 30 seconds or best effort up to that!

## To get started
1. Open an issue with your username, using the plank template
2. Plank 
  - At least 30 seconds (or best effort for that amount of time)
  - Does not need to be consecutive days, so there is no way to fall off the horse
  - Each time you plank, check a box!
